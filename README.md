# OSA-SE

OSA is an engine-like mod for Skyrim that adds on to it's potential in many ways. The heart of it is an animation framework that allows developers to have stronger control, effects, and usability in animated scenes. This ties in with OSA's PERSONA system that adds depth to character's personalities beyond what Skyrim provides.  Almost the entire OSA engine exists and runs in the UI of Skyriim which offers a lot of benefits as opposed to being run in Skyrim's papyrus. That gives all aspects of this project access to the UI for interactive displays, navigation and customization.

# Elements to Combine

## OSA-FLASH
Most of OSA is handled by the osa.swf file which is created using ActionScript2. The source code for the SWF is available in a separate git hosted here. A successful update of the osa.swf would be included here.

## OSA-Customizer
This is an xml document which handles some of OSA's default randomization for different races. I included it in a separate GIT so it's easier to work on but any final changes to the customizer xml document should potentially be included into the OSA zip.
